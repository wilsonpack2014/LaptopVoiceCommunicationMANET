/*
	This class will be used to periodically read the configuration file. 
	The configuration file's purpose is to update us on whether mobile users 
	have moved. 

	It needs to be capable of returning the necessary information from the 
	configuration file, so that, we can properly update the mobile user on it's 
	new location and neighbors

	Note: each mobile user will have access to the same configuration file due to 
	the set-up of Auburn University's H-drive system.
